# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.10.0] - 2026-08-25

- Large cleanup of internal and public API.
- Runtime dependencies removed (`byteorder`, `num_cpus`, `auto_impl`, and `memchr`).
- Deprecated items removed from the public API.
- Documentation overhaul: docs now center on CBQ as the recommended variant (VBQ is documented as superseded), examples use CBQ throughout, and docstrings are heavily simplified across the crate.

### Removed

- **`bq::StreamWriter` / `bq::StreamWriterBuilder`**
  - pure delegating wrappers; compose `bq::WriterBuilder` with `std::io::BufWriter` instead (see the `network_streaming` example).
- **Deprecated `write_record` / `write_paired_record`** on the `bq` and `vbq` writers
  - use `push(SequencingRecord)`.
- **`bq::Encoder`** from the public API
  - `bq` and `vbq` now share one internal encoder;
  - sequence-length validation happens in `bq::Writer::push`.
- **`vbq::BlockIndex::from_vbq`**
  - indexes are embedded in VBQ files - removing this holdover from way back when;
  - use `MmapReader::load_index`.
- **Redundant header constructors**
  - `bq::FileHeader::{new, new_extended, set_bitsize}` and `vbq::FileHeader::{new, with_capacity, set_bitsize}`;
  - use the `FileHeaderBuilder`s.
- **Never-constructed error variants**
  - the five `WriteError` flag-mismatch variants and `CbqError::MissingSequenceOnSequencingRecord`;
  - `BuilderError` folds into `HeaderError::MissingSequenceLength` and `FastxEncodingError` into `WriteError`.
- **`&R` / `&mut R` impls of `BinseqRecord`**
  - the `auto_impl` dependency is dropped and nothing used the reference impls;
  - pass records by value (they are already references anyways).
- Dead accessors throughout (`RefRecord::{config, set_id}`, `cbq` writer `usage` / `bytes_written`, and similar zero-caller items), plus the redundant `streaming` and `write` examples.

### Changed

- `SequencingRecord` fields are now public and the getters are removed
- FASTX encoding now drains only _completed_ blocks per batch and does a final drain per thread
  - CBQ blocks stay full across batches for better compression and less time under the global writer lock.
- Dependencies: `byteorder` replaced with `std` little-endian conversions (byte-identical output), `num_cpus` replaced with `std::thread::available_parallelism`, `auto_impl` dropped, and `memchr` moved to dev-dependencies.
- The `paraseq` feature is no longer enabled by default, reducing compile times when FASTX encoding is not needed. Enable it with `features = ["paraseq"]` to use `encode_fastx` (which remains visible on docs.rs with a feature banner).
- `anyhow` is now actually an optional dependency (still enabled by default; opt out with `default-features = false`):
  - the CBQ Elias-Fano codec is handled directly without the auto-derive from thiserror
  - fixes the optional feature which actually never compiled when disabled.
- Internal simplification:
  - one shared `bq`/`vbq` encoder
  - `BatchRecord` wraps `RefRecord`
  - `cbq` `Span` replaced by `Range<usize>`
  - unreachable `pub` items demoted to `pub(crate)`.

### Fixed

- The `error` test module was missing `#[cfg(test)]`, so a test-only enum compiled into release builds.
- `cbq::Index::average_block_size` reports `0.0` instead of `NaN` for files with fewer than two blocks.
- `encode_fastx` with single non-paired input no longer records second read's length as `xlen`
  - made fixed-length BQ output look paired and fail on interleaved encoding.
  - The extended length now only probes when builder is configured paired.

## [0.9.6] - 2026-08-12

### Changed

- `cbq` uses the `bitnuc` implementation with `u8`-based encoding with better SIMD perf
  - Does **not** change on-disk representation - block reading/writing is still done with u64 byte-boundaries and the format is unchanged.
- `cbq` blocks now use `bitnuc::ambiguous_bases` to find noncanonical bases instead of just `N` and adds them to the `npos` index.
- dependency both on `bitnuc-0.4` and `bitnuc-0.5` to keep 4-bit support for `bq` and `vbq` which is unsupported in `bitnuc-0.5.x`.

## [0.9.5] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- Support empty CBQ files in the `cbq` reader which previously failed due to index alignment error

## [0.9.4] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- Bug in the `bq` stream reader that used an incorrect record id for small buffers.

### Added

- `BinseqReader::new` now determines a file's BINSEQ format (BQ, VBQ, or CBQ) by sniffing its
  magic bytes instead of relying on the file extension, so it works regardless of how the file
  is named.
- `Format::sniff` for identifying a BINSEQ format from a byte buffer, plus public `FILE_MAGIC`
  constants on `bq`, `vbq`, and `cbq`.

### Changed

- Added clippy checks and additional lint allowances to CI, plus general style fixes.
- Improved test coverage throughout the library.
- Renamed `ExtensionError` to `FormatError` (`UnrecognizedMagicBytes` variant) to reflect
  detection now being based on file content rather than the file extension.

## [0.9.3] - 2026-07-01

### Changed

- `Binseq` input is now accepted as a path rather than a pre-opened handle.

### Fixed

- Use `reserve` instead of `resize` to avoid unnecessary zeroing/copies (issue #94).
- Ensure `len_nef` is cleared correctly.

### Tests

- Added coverage for the sequential reader and N-containing sequences.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- Support for writing only completed blocks, enabling on-thread compression and
  reducing lock contention for parallel writers.
- `on_thread_complete` callback support.
- `ingest_completed` is now passed through, with behavior changes scoped to `cbq`.

### Tests

- Added coverage for `cbq` ingestion.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-01-23

### Added

- Integrated `cbq` (compressed BINSEQ) into the core library as a first-class format.
- Builder-based construction of a file from an existing header.
- Auto-encode a FASTX file (or a pair of FASTX files) directly into a BINSEQ format via
  a builder method.
- A generic writer abstraction over BINSEQ files.
- Default quality score handling across all readers.
- Elias-Fano encoding for N-positions instead of raw `u64` indices, reducing index size.
- An iterator over block headers, and convenience accessors for index metadata.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** renamed `BINSEQ`/`VBINSEQ` naming throughout to `BQ`/`VBQ`
  (e.g. `BinseqHeader` → `bq::FileHeader`), and renamed several `vbq`/`bq`-specific
  headers and writer structs for clarity.
- Reworked the write API around a sequence record struct.
- Reworked the internal index to track record count and sequence count separately.
- Replaced `anyhow`-based errors throughout the crate with crate-native error types.
- Removed the external `vbq` index file in favor of writing the index into the file itself.

### Fixed

- Several small hotfixes to the write path.
- Incorrect binary file used in a test fixture.

## [0.8.1] - 2025-12-10

### Fixed

- Incorrect decoding of the extended buffer on batch decoding in `bq` when a full
  chunk of primary data was present (issue #75).

## [0.8.0] - 2025-12-10

### Added

- `sseq`/`xseq` functions on the record trait for use during batch decoding, implemented
  for both `bq` and `vbq`.
- Additional usage examples.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** improved `bq` decoding via batch decoding, keeping data in SIMD form longer.
- Improved header access logic for zero-copy reads.

### Fixed

- Correct index returned from decoding.
- Correct slicing when per-record flags are set in `bq`.

## [0.7.8] - 2025-12-09

### Changed

- `vbq` reader is now zero-copy or single-copy depending on compression status.
- Simplified the encoding API.
- Reusable decompression context for improved throughput.
- Updated all dependencies.

### Fixed

- Validate the size of bytes provided to the non-compressed reader.

## [0.7.7] - 2025-12-08

### Changed

- Split the sequencing context into multiple traits with distinct variants
  (renamed `FullCtx` to `Ctx`).
- Removed unsafe code from the context implementation in favor of a resize-copy pattern.

### Fixed

- Logical error in quality-score padding (`ensure_quality`).

### Docs

- Documented the different context variants.

## [0.7.6] - 2025-12-08

### Added

- A basic sequencing context struct, with mutable references to its internals.
- Ability to fill in missing quality scores when required.
- A generic error-conversion trait, made public.

## [0.7.5] - 2025-10-02

### Added

- BINSEQ v2 format.
- Optional headers in `vbq` files, with the index moved into the file itself
  (no more auxiliary index file).
- Support for 4-bit encodings, with a `bitsize` re-export so downstream users don't
  need to depend on `bitnuc` directly.
- Header builder pattern for constructing `bq` and `vbq` files.

### Changed

- Per-record flags are now optional across `bq`, `vbq`, and the record API.
- `vbq` index now uses `u64` for cumulative record counts.
